# Wrangle-and-analyze-data
In this project, I used python libraries to gather, access, clean and visualize a dataset
The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
